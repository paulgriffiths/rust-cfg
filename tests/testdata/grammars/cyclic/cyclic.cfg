# A grammar with cycles. A is cyclic with itself (and is unrealizable), and
# B, E and F form a cyclic group with each other. G is cyclic because G → G H
# is a production, and H derives ϵ. C and D are not cyclic.

S → A | B | C | D | G
A → A
B → E | 'b'
E → F | 'e'
F → B | 'f'
C → 'c'
D → 'd'
G → G H
H → 'h' | ϵ
