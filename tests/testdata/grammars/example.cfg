# The below is an example of a context-free grammar recognized by this
# application. The conventions are:
#  - Comments begin with # and are ignored through the end of the line
#  - Whitespace is ignored except where required to provide separation
#    between terminals and non-terminals
#  - Non-terminals begin with an alphabetic character (excluding any
#    alphabetic characters denoting ϵ-production bodies) and followed by any
#    number of alphabetic characters, underscores, or primes (')
#  - Terminals are quoted by either single- or double-quotes, and may contain
#    escape characters \n, \r or \t (the backslash itself must also be
#    escaped). Quotes may also be escaped with the backslash.
#  - All terminals are single characters in the grammar itself, but for
#    convenience a string of terminals may be enclosed in a single set of
#    quotes, and they will be separated into individual characters during
#    translation.
#  - An empty production body can be either ϵ or a single underscore
#  - The production symbol can be either → or ::=
#  - The alternative production separator is the vertical pipe |. Alternatives
#    can continue on subsequent lines provided the first non-whitespace
#    character is a vertical pipe
#
# This particular example is adapted from Aho et al (2007) p.193.
