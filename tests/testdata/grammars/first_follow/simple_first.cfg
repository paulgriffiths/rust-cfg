# Simple grammar for demonstrating and testing FIRST.
#
# B is the only non-terminal which derives ϵ, so:
#  - FIRST(B) is ('f', 'c', ϵ)
#  - FIRST(C) is ('s', 'e')
#  - FIRST(D) is ('b')
#
# In combination:
#  - FIRST(BD) is ('f', 'c', 'b')
#  - FIRST(CD) is ('s', 'e')
#  - FIRST(A) is ('f', 'c', 'b', 's', 'e')

A → B D | C D
B → 'fish' | 'chips' | ϵ
C → 'sausage' | 'egg'
D → 'bacon'
